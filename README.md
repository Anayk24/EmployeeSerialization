Assignment Name:**Employee Serialization

##  Project Overview This project demonstrates how to: 
1. Read employee data from a text file (`employees.txt`).
2. Serialize (save) the list of employees into a binary file (`employees.dat`).
3. Deserialize (load) the list of employees back from the binary file. 4. Display the deserialized employee details on the console.
4. It highlights the use of:
5. - **File Handling** (reading text files) -
   - **Serialization & Deserialization** in Java
   - **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts
   ## Sample Input(`employees.txt`):
   <img width="9592" height="4432" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad406de-5ad0-443d-bcdc-c86b5704497d" />
45, Anay Khandelwal, 50000
18, Aryan Nagdev, 60000
7, Pranav Vispute, 55000
## Sample Output   
Employees serialized successfully!

Employees deserialized successfully!

Employees from deserialized file:

Employee [ID=45, Name=Anay Khandelwal, Salary=50000.0]

Employee [ID=18, Name=Aryan Nagdev, Salary=60000.0]

Employee [ID=7, Name=Pranav Vispute, Salary=55000.0]

##  Conclusion
This assignment successfully demonstrates **employee serialization and deserialization** in Java, bridging file handling with object persistence. It serves as a foundational exercise for backend development workflows.
